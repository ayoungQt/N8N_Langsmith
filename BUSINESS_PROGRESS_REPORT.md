**Project:** Automated Guard Prompt Retraining

**Objective:** To build an automated system that identifies "False Positive" feedback in Langsmith, uses it to retrain AI guard prompts, and saves the improved version.

**Progress & Key Developments:**

*   **Successful API Connection:** We have successfully established a connection to the Langsmith API. After significant debugging, we are now able to pull the specific "False Positive" feedback data, which is the critical first step for the entire process.
*   **Scalable Design:** The workflow has been redesigned to be fully scalable. Instead of handling just one guard, it now reads from a master list, allowing it to process all of your guards in a single run. This architecture will make the system much easier to maintain and expand in the future.
*   **Error Handling Framework:** We have set up the foundation for robust error handling. A separate, dedicated workflow has been built that will send an email alert if the main process fails unexpectedly, ensuring we're aware of any problems.

**Current Status & Immediate Focus:**

*   We are actively debugging the workflow's main processing loop.
*   **Current Blocker:** We are encountering an error at the data-checking step, which occurs immediately after the feedback is fetched from Langsmith.
*   **Next Step:** Our entire focus is on resolving this error. Once fixed, the data should flow correctly into the prompt analysis and refinement stages of the workflow.
