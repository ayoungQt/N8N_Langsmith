**Status:** Stable multi-guard retraining with multi-example analysis and clean outputs

**What changed today**
- The workflow now consolidates multiple feedback items per guard and analyzes them as numbered examples. This yields higher-quality, pattern-based insights instead of single-case summaries.
- Added a lightweight audit footer to the analysis so we can verify the model actually used several examples (`examples_used`, `total_examples`).
- Fixed prior duplication issues by isolating model inputs and ensuring the chain runs once per guard only.
- Improved document naming (guard + ISO date) and Google Sheets logging (clickable links, correct guard names per row).

**Impact**
- More reliable guard refinements due to aggregated evidence.
- Faster review and better traceability via explicit evidence output.
- Clean, one‑per‑guard outputs: exactly one doc and one sheet row per guard.

**Next**
- Optionally enforce minimum coverage (≥3 examples) by parsing `examples_used` and retrying if insufficient.
- Add a friendly display name mapping for guards in logs and docs.

**Status:** Significant progress; multi-guard retraining flow validated end-to-end

**Highlights:**
- The workflow now groups multiple feedback items per guard and produces one consolidated retraining document per guard (validated with 3 guards in a single run).
- Drive search reliably locates the correct guard prompt file per guard (name + folder filter), and downloads succeed for all items.
- The case file assembly now includes aggregated user inputs and bot errors per guard, giving better context for refinement.
- LLM prompt updated to use decoded guard prompt text and new feedback fields (`verdict`, `false_positive_category`, `reasoning`), replacing deprecated fields.
- Google Sheets logging writes one row per guard with dynamic doc links; clickable links confirmed.

**Impact:**
- Eliminates duplicate document creation per guard; improves reviewer efficiency and consistency.
- More accurate analysis due to full context of all related feedback per guard.
- Reduces manual intervention by automating file discovery and robust logging.

**Next Focus:**
- Polish presentation in the case file (optional numbering/limits for long lists).
- Add friendly display names for guards (mapping) where needed.
- Parameterize the date window calc (already added) and consider holiday calendars for business-day offsets.

**Status:** In Progress

**Summary:**

The automated guard retraining workflow has been significantly upgraded to handle feedback more intelligently. Previously, if five feedback items were found for the "Financial Guard," the system would incorrectly try to create five separate new documents.

The system now correctly consolidates all feedback for each specific guard. If it finds six feedback items for the "Human Assistant Guard" and three for the "Hallucination Guard," it will now correctly generate only two new documents: one master document for each guard, containing all relevant feedback. This makes the retraining process much more efficient and produces the desired outcome.

We have identified the final bug preventing this from working perfectly and are ready to implement the fix.

### **Business Progress Report**

**Date:** July 20, 2024
**Project:** Automated Guard Prompt Retraining

**Objective:** To build an automated system that identifies "False Positive" feedback in Langsmith, uses it to retrain AI guard prompts, and saves the improved version.

**Progress & Key Developments: Major Breakthrough**

Today we achieved a significant milestone: the entire data-gathering and preparation section of the workflow is now fully functional and robust. After a series of complex debugging sessions, we have successfully resolved all issues from the start of the workflow through finding and downloading the correct guardrail prompt file from Google Drive.

*   **End-to-End Data Retrieval Confirmed:** The system can now correctly:
    1.  Fetch "False Positive" feedback from Langsmith.
    2.  Filter out bad data and loop through valid records.
    3.  Query the Langsmith API again to get detailed "run" information.
    4.  Intelligently match the run to the correct guardrail file name.
    5.  Reliably find and download that specific file from your Google Drive prompts folder.
*   **Technical Stability Achieved:** We resolved several deep-seated technical issues related to n8n version compatibility and data handling. The workflow logic is now cleaner, more resilient, and uses modern best practices, which will ensure reliable operation.

**Current Status & Next Steps**

With the data retrieval portion complete, we are now positioned to complete the final, value-generating stage of the project.

The immediate next steps are:
1.  **Configure the AI Processing:** Connect the downloaded file content and the user conversation transcript to the first AI node (`LLM 1: Analyze & Generate Example`).
2.  **Test the AI Chain:** Run the workflow to test the AI's ability to analyze the data and generate the refined prompt.
3.  **Finalize Output:** Ensure the final refined prompt is correctly saved to a new Google Doc and the process is logged in the Google Sheet.

We have overcome the most significant technical hurdles and are now on the final stretch to completing the project.

**Project:** Automated Guard Prompt Retraining

**Objective:** To build an automated system that identifies "False Positive" feedback in Langsmith, uses it to retrain AI guard prompts, and saves the improved version.

**Progress & Key Developments: From Foundation to Functionality**

Today's session was focused on targeted debugging of the main workflow, resulting in several critical fixes that have significantly advanced the project's stability and functionality.

*   **Successful Langsmith API Connection:** We have successfully connected to Langsmiths API for the css_service_AI instance and can retreieve feedback records.
*   **Successful Data Filtering:** We have successfully repaired the initial data filtering and checking steps. The workflow is now correctly identifying when Langsmith has provided records and is prepared to loop through them. This resolves a key blocker that was preventing the workflow from proceeding.
*   **Robust File Searching:** We have fixed the Google Drive integration. The system can now reliably locate the correct guardrail prompt file for the specific "false positive" record it is processing. This was a critical failure point that has now been resolved.
*   **Streamlined & Simplified Logic:** We have refactored a core part of the workflow, removing a confusing and unnecessary step. The system is now easier to understand and maintain, which will reduce the likelihood of future errors.

**Current Status & Next Steps**

The workflow is now logically sound and stable through the initial data-gathering and filtering stages. We have successfully addressed all identified blockers from the start of the workflow up to the point of processing a "false positive" record.

The next steps are:
1.  **End-to-End Test:** We need to trigger the workflow with a valid "false positive" record to test the complete `true` path, from finding the Google Drive file all the way through the AI refinement and logging steps.
2.  **Verify Final Steps:** Based on the test run, we will diagnose and resolve any issues that appear in the second half of the workflow.

### **Business Progress Report**

**Date:** July 18, 2024
**Project:** Automated Guard Prompt Retraining

**Objective:** To build an automated system that identifies "False Positive" feedback in Langsmith, uses it to retrain AI guard prompts, and saves the improved version.

**Progress & Key Developments: From High-Level Design to Stable Implementation**

Following our initial success in establishing the core, dynamic framework on the 17th, today's focus shifted entirely to improving the stability, compatibility, and technical foundation of the workflow.

*   **Workflow Hardening & Compatibility:** We addressed a critical compatibility issue with your version of n8n. The "Merge" nodes, which were causing unpredictable behavior, have been explicitly configured to use a specific mode ("Merge by Position"). This ensures that data flows through the workflow reliably every time it runs.
*   **Simplified Data Flow:** We refactored a key part of the workflow to make it simpler and more efficient. Instead of merging data streams together, we updated the "Get Initial Feedback" node to pull its configuration directly from the source. This removes a potential point of failure and makes the workflow easier to understand and maintain.

**Current Status & Next Steps**

The project remains in the active debugging phase. The work done today was crucial for building a stable foundation, but the workflow is not yet fully operational. Our immediate focus remains on executing the workflow and resolving the runtime errors that are preventing a complete run.

The plan to achieve a successful execution is as follows:
1.  **Isolate the Point of Failure:** Execute the workflow to confirm the exact node where it is currently failing.
2.  **Resolve the Error:** Analyze the specific error message and input data at the failing node to diagnose and implement a fix.
3.  **Iterative Testing:** Continue this process of running, identifying the next failure point, and resolving it until the workflow completes successfully from start to finish.

### Business Report (Corrected)

**To:** Project Stakeholders
**From:** AI Assistant
**Date:** July 17, 2024
**Subject:** Progress Update on the Automated Guardrail Prompt Retraining System

#### Summary
This report outlines recent progress on the "Guard Prompt Retraining" workflow. Over the last period, we have performed a significant overhaul, redesigning the core architecture to address several foundational issues. We have implemented fixes for critical bugs related to API interactions, data configuration, and system compatibility.

**Crucially, the project remains in an active development and debugging phase.** While the foundational logic has been corrected, the workflow is not yet fully operational and we are working to resolve runtime errors. The recent changes have laid the necessary groundwork for a stable system, and our current focus is on iterative testing and fixing to achieve a successful end-to-end execution.

#### Key Progress & Implemented Solutions

*   **Designed for Full Automation:**
    *   **What we did:** The workflow has been re-architected to be fully dynamic. The new design allows the system to loop through all 8 of your specified AI guardrails automatically.
    *   **Business Impact (Intended):** Once operational, this will eliminate the need for manual configuration changes and ensure all safety prompts are continuously monitored and improved, drastically reducing manual effort.

*   **Corrected Core API and Data Logic:**
    *   **What we did:** We have corrected the fundamental logic for how the system queries the Langsmith API and handles your Google Drive files. The configuration data for all guardrails and file names has been updated to match your production environment precisely.
    *   **Business Impact (Intended):** These fixes are critical for ensuring the system will pull the correct data. Once the workflow is running, this will ensure prompt refinements are based on accurate "False Positive" feedback, leading to higher-quality safety guardrails.

*   **Improved System Stability and Error Handling:**
    *   **What we did:** We have implemented several changes to improve compatibility with your specific version of n8n, which was a source of previous failures. We have also built in an automated email alert that will notify you immediately if the workflow fails during an execution.
    *   **Business Impact (Intended):** These-changes are designed to make the system more resilient and predictable. The proactive error monitoring will provide confidence that any future issues will be caught and addressed quickly once the system is deployed.

#### Current Status & Next Steps

The workflow is **not yet production-ready.** Despite implementing the significant architectural changes described above, the system currently fails during execution and requires further debugging.

Our immediate priority is to work through the remaining runtime errors. The next steps are:
1.  Continue to execute the workflow node by node to isolate the exact point of failure.
2.  Analyze and resolve the errors as they appear.
3.  Repeat this iterative testing and debugging process until we achieve a complete, successful run.

We are actively working to resolve these final issues and will provide another update once the workflow is fully functional.
